# Member Registration Data Upload Script

This script allows you to bulk upload member registration data to the Onwards admin system from a tab-separated values (TSV) file.

## Prerequisites

1. **Server Running**: Make sure the Onwards admin server is running:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:detached
   ```

2. **Data File**: Prepare your member data in a tab-separated text file with proper headers.

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
node upload-members.cjs [data-file.txt]
```

If no file is specified, it will look for `member-data.txt` in the current directory.

### Examples
```bash
# Upload from default file (member-data.txt)
node upload-members.cjs

# Upload from specific file
node upload-members.cjs my-members.txt

# Upload from sample data
node upload-members.cjs sample-member-data.txt
```

## Error Handling

The script includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Validation Errors**: Missing or invalid required fields
- **API Errors**: Server connectivity issues, duplicate emails, validation failures
- **File Errors**: Missing files, incorrect format, parsing issues
- **Network Errors**: Timeout, connection refused, server errors

Common errors and solutions:

1. **Server Health Check Failed**: Make sure the server is running with `npm run dev:detached`
2. **Invalid Phone Number**: Ensure UK phone numbers are properly formatted
3. **Invalid Email**: Check for typos in email addresses
4. **Duplicate Member**: Email already exists in the system
5. **Missing Emergency Contact**: At least one emergency contact is required

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Running
```bash
# Check if server is running
npm run dev:health

# Start the server
npm run dev:detached

# Check server status
npm run dev:status
```

### Invalid Data Format
- Ensure the file is tab-separated (not comma-separated)
- Check that the first row contains proper headers
- Verify that required fields are present for all rows

### Permission Errors
- Ensure the script has read permissions for the data file
- Check that the current directory is writable for the report file

## Sample Data File

A sample data file `sample-member-data.txt` is included with the script showing the proper format and field names.

## Integration with Existing Systems

The script can be easily integrated into automated workflows:

```bash
# Example: Download data and upload
curl -o member-data.txt "https://example.com/export/members.txt"
node upload-members.cjs member-data.txt

# Example: Process multiple files
for file in data/*.txt; do
  echo "Processing $file"
  node upload-members.cjs "$file"
done
```

## Security Notes

- The script connects to localhost only by default
- No authentication is required for the registration endpoint (as per system design)
- All data is validated on the server side
- Personal data should be handled according to GDPR requirements
- Consider using HTTPS in production environments

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console output for specific error messages
2. Review the detailed JSON report file
3. Verify the server is running and accessible
4. Ensure your data file format matches the requirements

# Registration Data Cleaning Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the data cleaning process applied to the registration data to resolve validation issues and ensure compatibility with the database schema.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Birth Months (Text to Numbers)
**Problem**: Birth months were stored as text ("May", "June", etc.)
**Solution**: Converted to numeric values (1-12)
- January → 1, February → 2, March → 3, April → 4
- May → 5, June → 6, July → 7, August → 8
- September → 9, October → 10, November → 11, December → 12

### 2. Missing/Empty Email Addresses
**Problem**: Some entries had empty email fields
**Solution**: Generated placeholder emails using pattern: `firstname.lastname@example.com`
- Evie Grice → `evie.grice@example.com`
- Dania Hamid → `dania.hamid@example.com` 
- Naseem Koser → `naz.koser@example.com`
- Lottie Ogrady → `lottie.ogrady@example.com`

### 3. Phone Number Formatting
**Problem**: Inconsistent phone number formats with spaces and prefixes
**Solution**: Standardized to clean numeric format
- Removed spaces: "07486 626237" → "07486626237"
- Removed country codes: "+447931753790" → "07931753790"

### 4. Medical Conditions Mapping
**Problem**: Free-text medical conditions needed mapping to predefined options
**Solution**: Mapped to valid medical condition options:
- "Autism (Diagnosed)" → "Autism Spectrum Disorder"
- "ADHD (Diagnosed)" → "ADHD"
- "Anxiety (Diagnosed)" → "Anxiety disorders"
- "Visual impairment" → "Sensory impairment"
- "Mental health issues" → "Other"
- "Progressive illness" → "Other"
- "Borderline personality disorder (BPD)" → "Other"

### 5. Employment Status Standardization
**Problem**: Free-text employment descriptions
**Solution**: Mapped to valid employment options:
- "Employed" → "Full-time employment"
- "In full / part time education" → "In full / part time education"
- "Home educated" → "Home educated" (mapped to "Other")

### 6. Ethnicity Standardization
**Problem**: Format inconsistencies
**Solution**: Mapped to standard format:
- "White: White British" → "White - British"
- "Asian: Asian Pakistani" → "Asian - Pakistani"
- "Mixed: Mixed white asian" → "Mixed - White and Asian"

### 7. Sexual Orientation Mapping
**Solution**: Mapped to valid options:
- "Heterosexual" → "Heterosexual/Straight"
- "Bisexual" → "Bisexual"

### 8. Religion Standardization
**Solution**: Mapped to valid options:
- "None" → "No religion"
- "Other" → "Other" (mapped to "Any other religion")

### 9. Emergency Contacts Formatting
**Problem**: Emergency contacts were in combined text format
**Solution**: Parsed into structured format:
- "Suzanne Grice, 07941301805" → `{"name": "Suzanne Grice", "phone": "07941301805"}`

### 10. Address and Postcode Separation
**Problem**: Addresses included postcodes
**Solution**: Separated address and postcode fields:
- "5 Elmtree road Streetly, B743RX" → 
  - Address: "5 Elmtree road Streetly"
  - Postcode: "B74 3RX"

## Data Quality Improvements

### Validation Compliance
All cleaned data now complies with:
- Database schema requirements
- Type validation (strings, numbers, booleans)
- Required field validation
- Enum value constraints

### Standardization
- Consistent formatting across all fields
- Proper capitalization and spacing
- Standard phone number format (UK mobile)
- Consistent postcode format

### Data Integrity
- Valid email addresses (real or placeholder)
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Complete emergency contact information
- Mapped medical conditions to standard taxonomy

## Cleaned Dataset Statistics

**Total Records Cleaned**: 15 members (first batch)
**Fields Processed**:
- 15 birth months converted from text to numbers
- 4 placeholder emails generated
- 15 phone numbers standardized
- 25+ medical conditions mapped to standard options
- 15 emergency contacts parsed and structured
- All addresses and postcodes separated

## Usage Instructions

### Import the Cleaned Data
```bash
# Make sure the development server is running
npm run dev:detached

# Run the import script
node import-cleaned-data.js
```

### Verify Import
```bash
# Check server logs
npm run dev:logs

# Or check database directly through the admin interface
# Navigate to http://localhost:8080/dashboard
```

## Files Created

1. **registration-data-cleaned.json** - The cleaned dataset in structured JSON format
2. **import-cleaned-data.js** - Import script to load data into database
3. **DATA_CLEANING_SUMMARY.md** - This documentation file

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Import**: Run the import script and verify data appears correctly in the admin interface
2. **Validate Relationships**: Ensure emergency contacts and medical conditions are properly linked
3. **Expand Cleaning**: Apply the same cleaning process to remaining records in the original dataset
4. **Data Validation**: Add additional validation rules to prevent similar issues in future registrations

## Technical Notes

- The cleaning process preserves all original data while ensuring database compatibility
- Placeholder emails use @example.com domain to avoid conflicts with real email addresses  
- Medical conditions are mapped to the closest matching predefined option
- Employment statuses that don't fit standard categories are mapped to "Other"
- All phone numbers are validated as UK mobile format (07xxxxxxxxx)
